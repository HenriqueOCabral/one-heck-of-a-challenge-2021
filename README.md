## In the Client directory, you can see how I handled ReactJs(plus SOLID principles, templates, etc), React Hooks, Context API, Serverless Integrations, Events, States, and many more Props on the client side 
## In the CloudServer directory, you can see how I developed a solution to bypass lambda payload restrictions using binary encoding, how I handled AWS Services and client integrations using DynamoDB, S3, Lambdas, Vendor Private SDK, Rekognition, SQS, CloudFront, and ReactJs App.
